    abstract = "{Large amounts of information generated by genomic technologies are accompanied by statistical and computational challenges due to redundancy, badly behaved data and noise. Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been developed to mitigate these challenges. However, many approaches are not scalable to large dimensions or result in excessive information loss.The proposed approach partitions data into subsets of related features and summarizes each into one and only one new feature, thus defining a surjective mapping. A constraint on information loss determines the size of the reduced dataset. Simulation studies demonstrate that when multiple related features are associated with a response, this approach can substantially increase the number of true associations detected as compared to principal components analysis, non-negative matrix factorization or no DR. This increase in true discoveries is explained both by a reduced multiple-testing challenge and a reduction in extraneous noise. In an application to real data collected from metastatic colorectal cancer tumors, more associations between gene expression features and progression free survival and response to treatment were detected in the reduced than in the full untransformed dataset.Freely available R package from CRAN, https://cran.r-project.org/package=partition.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Individually, these technologies have contributed medical advances that have begun to enter clinical practice. However, each technology individually cannot capture the entire biological complexity of most human diseases. Integration of multiple technologies has emerged as an approach to provide a more comprehensive view of biology and disease. In this Review, we discuss the potential for combining diverse types of data and the utility of this approach in human health and disease. We provide examples of data integration to understand, diagnose and inform treatment of diseases, including rare and common diseases as well as cancer and transplant biology. Finally, we discuss technical and other challenges to clinical implementation of integrative omics.},

abstract = "Precision medicine proposes to individualize the practice of medicine based on patients’ genetic backgrounds, their biomarker characteristics and other omics datasets. After outlining the key challenges in precision medicine, namely patient stratification, biomarker discovery and drug repurposing, we survey recent developments in high-throughput technologies and big biological datasets that shape the future of precision medicine. Furthermore, we provide an overview of recent data-integrative approaches that have been successfully used in precision medicine for mining medical knowledge from big-biological data, and we highlight modeling and computing issues that such integrative approaches will face due to the ever-growing nature of big-biological data. Finally, we raise attention to the challenges in translational medicine when moving from research findings to approved medical practices."
