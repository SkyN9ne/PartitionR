Description: A fast and flexible framework for agglomerative partitioning. partition uses an approach 
  called Direct-Measure-Reduce to create new variables that maintain the 
  user-specified minimum level of information. Each reduced variable is also interpretable:
  the original variables map to one and only one variable in the reduced data set. partition 
  is flexible, as well: how variables are selected to reduce, how information loss is measured, 
  and the way data is reduced can all be customized.
